            By visually representing different regional prices on the map of Australia, GDC helps users easily identify trends and make comparisons, specifically using a heatmap. Out of the various grocery items listed, only a handful of selected categories exhibit price variations across different states in Australia, as observed in Coles supermarkets in September 2022.
